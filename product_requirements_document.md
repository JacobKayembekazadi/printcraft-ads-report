# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature Name: PrintCraft DTF Campaign Analysis Web App

---

## Problem Statement

Small businesses and marketing teams running Instagram advertising campaigns for PrintCraft DTF lack an easy, visual way to analyze campaign performance, compare results, and receive actionable recommendations for optimization. Existing solutions are either too complex, generic, or require manual data wrangling, making it difficult to quickly identify what works and where to improve.
